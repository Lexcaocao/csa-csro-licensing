The Cybersecurity Services Regulation Office (“CSRO”) was set up on 4 April 2022 to administer the licensing framework for the cybersecurity service provider (“CSP”) under the Cybersecurity Act which aims to address three main considerations over time:
<br>(a)	Provide greater assurance of security and safety to consumers
<br>(b)	Improve the standards and standing of CSP
<br>(c)	Address the information asymmetry between consumers and the CSP
<br><br>The responsibilities of CSRO include:
* Issuance and revocation of CSP licence; 
* Maintain register of licensed CSP;
* Conduct enforcement and investigation of breaches and offences under the Cybersecurity Act and Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Service Providers) Regulations; and
* Share resources and conduct outreach to the cybersecurity industry.
