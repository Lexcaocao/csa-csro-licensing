notification: With effect from the launch of licensing framework on 11 April
  2022, all providers who are engaged in the business of providing LCS, have
  until 11 October 2022 to apply for a licence. Providers who have submitted
  their licence application to CSRO between 11 April 2022 and 11 October 2022,
  may continue to engage in the business of providing LCS until a decision is
  made on their licence application. In the event that the application for a
  licence is refused, the provider would not be allowed to engage or continue to
  engage in the business of providing the LCS. Any providers providing the LCS
  after 11 October 2022, without having lodged an application for a licence for
  the LCS they engage in, will be deemed to be operating illegally.
