	<summary><h5>1 Who needs to apply for cybersecurity service provider licence?</h5></summary>
	
All providers of managed security operations centre (“SOC”) monitoring services and penetration testing services to the Singapore market will need to apply for a cybersecurity service provider’s (“CSP”) licence, regardless of whether they are companies or individuals or third-party CSPs that provide these services in support of other CSPs. However, a company that provides licensable services solely for its related company(s) e.g., in-house service provider, does not require a licence. Related company has the same meaning given to it by section 6 of the Companies Act (Cap.50). Resellers or overseas CSPs including the affiliates of a licensee who provide licensable cybersecurity services to the Singapore market will need to be licensed.
