#### Criteria for Grant of a Licence
To be eligible for a licence, applicant is required to be fit and proper.

#### Fit and Proper Criteria
As stipulated in section 26(8) of the Cybersecurity Act, in deciding whether an individual or a business entity is a fit and proper person to hold or continue to hold a licence, the licensing officer may take into account any matter the licensing officer considers relevant, including any of the following:
<br>(a) In the case of an individual —
* that the individual has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere of any offence involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude;
<br>(ii)	that the individual has had a judgment entered against the individual in civil proceedings that involves a finding of fraud, dishonesty or breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the individual;
<br>(iii)	that the individual is or was suffering from a mental health condition (for example, psychotic disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or personality disorder etc)*
<br>(iv)	that the individual is an undischarged bankrupt or has entered into a composition with the creditors of the individual; or
<br>(v)	that the individual has had a licence revoked by the licensing officer previously.

*If the mental health condition is properly managed and certified by a qualified physician or healthcare professional, the presence of a mental health condition will not affect a person’s eligibility to be licensed.
