<li><font size="4.5">With effect from the commencement of the licensing framework on 4 April 2022, all providers who are engaged in the business of providing LCS, have until 4 October 2022 to apply for a licence. Providers who have submitted their licence application to CSRO between 4 April 2022 and 4 October 2022, may continue to engage in the business until a decision is made on their licence application. Any providers providing the LCS after 4 October 2022, without having lodged an application for a licence, will be deemed to be operating illegally. In the event that the application for a licence is refused, the provider would not be allowed to engage or continue to engage in the business of providing the LCS.</font></li>
